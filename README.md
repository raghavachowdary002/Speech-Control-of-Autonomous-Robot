# Speech-Control-of-Autonomous-Robot

This project goal is to design a moving robot which takes a voice command given by a human and performs the action accordingly. The speech recognition framework refers to a system where a person can talk to a computer through a microphone. The computer converts the words into text or commands to perform computer functions. The intelligent speech recognition system makes spoken instructions understandable by the robot. The speech-recognition system is trained to recognize given commands and the programmed robot navigates through the speech commands based on the instructions. The results prove that the proposed robot is capable of understanding the meaning of speech commands given as a recorded input. This robot simulation has been carried in ROS middleware and the map has been designed in Gazebo.
